# Meoweather

**Meoweather** is a cozy, animated weather app built with love by [Aya](https://github.com/AyaKhellou) — powered by real-time data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and styled with a soft, pastel aesthetic.
It features a custom-drawn animated SVG cat and switches between day and night modes automatically.

## 🔮 Features

* ☁️ Live updates for:

* 🐱 Custom animated weather cat
* Automatic day/night mode based on real-time data

## 🛠 Tech Stack

## 🧠 How it Works

- The user searches a city.
- The app fetches data from OpenWeatherMap.
- Based on the icon code + time, it updates the background, cat mood, and weather card.

## ⚠️ Security Note

The API key is securely stored in a `.env` file and accessed using `import.meta.env.VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY`.  
The live version is built and deployed via Vite, and **the actual key is not exposed in the code**.
